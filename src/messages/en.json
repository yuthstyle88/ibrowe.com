    "title": "iBrowe vs Edge",
    "subtitle": "Microsoft Edge is the successor to Internet Explorer and is the world's third most used browser (and second on desktop). But this is mostly because it's the default browser on Windows devices. Few people choose to switch to Edge on their own. While Edge has some good features and is optimized for Windows, when it comes to privacy, performance, and important features, Edge is missing a lot. Let's compare them.",
    "downloadButton": "Download iBrowe",
    "privacyTitle": "Is iBrowe more private than Edge?",
    "privacyDescription": "Microsoft is an example of 'Big Tech' and one of the world's most valuable companies. While most of its profits come from selling PCs and software like Windows, advertising is also a massive revenue source. And those ads are mostly found in Edge (and the Bing search engine). Edge tracks you across the web and collects as much data as possible. Microsoft 'monetizes' this data in the form of highly targeted ads. For Microsoft, Edge is about advertising and profit. Meanwhile, iBrowe blocks almost all attempts to track you:",
    "privacyConclusion": "In short, Edge is built for tracking. It allows creepy ads, trackers, cookies, and more to follow you around the web, record everything you do, and link that activity directly to you. All without your knowledge or consent. Meanwhile, iBrowe is private by default.",
    "featuresTitle": "Does iBrowe have more features than Edge?",
    "featuresDescription": "Both iBrowe and Edge are built on the open-source Chromium browser engine (the same one used in other browsers like Chrome, Opera, and Vivaldi). So you can expect similar looks and functions. But when it comes to things beyond those similarities, iBrowe has many customizations that Edge can't compete with.",

    "featuresDescription": "Compare the key features of iBrowe and Safari",
    "featuresComparison": "Browe is built on the open-source Chromium engine the same one that powers Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi. Safari, on the other hand, uses Apple's own open-source WebKit engine.Both browsers offer essential features like  bookmarks and tabs. But when it comes to extensions, Safari relies on the Apple App Store, with a limited selection. iBrowe supports a much broader range via the Chrome Web Store. ",
    "footerNoteComparison": "Some smaller features like translation and tab groups are available in both browsers. But to match iBrowe's full functionality, Safari requires multiple extensions. Unfortunately, that can introduce security risks and slow down your browsing experience. When it comes to overall capability, iBrowe outperforms Safari by a wide margin.",

We believe browsing should be smooth, secure, and free from hidden agendas. iBrowe isn't just a browser, it's your gateway to a faster, safer, and more independent internet experience. See the difference today. Experience browsing, redefined.",
    "downloadButton": "Download iBrowe",
    "privacyTitle": "Does iBrowe offer better privacy than Chrome?",
    "privacyDescription": "Google is a leading example of 'Big Tech' and one of the most valuable companies in the world. While many think of Google as a magical box, so influential it even inspired the verb 'to google' at its core, Google is an advertising company. The bulk of Google's multi-billion-dollar revenue comes from selling ads. To fuel this system, Chrome and Google Search are designed to collect as much information about you as possible. They then monetize this data by delivering highly targeted ads. The more they know about you, the more money they make.",
    "privacyConclusion": "In contrast, iBrowe shields you from tracking almost everywhere. Chrome was built with tracking in mind. It allows intrusive ads, trackers, cookies, and more to follow you across the web recording everything you do and often linking it directly to you, without your knowledge or consent. iBrowe, on the other hand, puts your privacy first by default.",
    "featuresTitle": "Does iBrowe offer more features than Chrome?",
    "featuresDescription": "Both iBrowe and Chrome are built on Chromium, the open-source browser engine that also powers Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi. As a result, they share a similar look and feel, along with core features like bookmarks and tab management. Any extension that works with Chrome will work with iBrowe too, although iBrowe comes packed with so many built-in features that you might not need extensions at all.",
    "featuresComparison": "Beyond these shared foundations, iBrowe offers a range of specially tailored features. When it comes to convenience and useful features, iBrowe is far ahead. To achieve the same level of functionality in Chrome, you'd need to install multiple extensions each one potentially slowing down performance and increasing security risks. There's no question: iBrowe wins hands down when it comes to built-in functionality.",
