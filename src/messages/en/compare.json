  "EdgeComparison": {
    "title": "iBrowe vs Edge",
    "subtitle": "Microsoft Edge is the successor to Internet Explorer and is the world's third most used browser (and second on desktop). But this is mostly because it's the default browser on Windows devices. Few people choose to switch to Edge on their own. While Edge has some good features and is optimized for Windows, when it comes to privacy, performance, and important features, Edge is missing a lot. Let's compare them.",

    "privacyTitle": "Is iBrowe more private than Edge?",
    "privacyDescription": "Microsoft is an example of 'Big Tech' and one of the world's most valuable companies. While most of its profits come from selling PCs and software like Windows, advertising is also a massive revenue source. And those ads are mostly found in Edge (and the Bing search engine). Edge tracks you across the web and collects as much data as possible. Microsoft 'monetizes' this data in the form of highly targeted ads. For Microsoft, Edge is about advertising and profit. Meanwhile, iBrowe blocks almost all attempts to track you:",
    "privacyConclusion": "In short, Edge is built for tracking. It allows creepy ads, trackers, cookies, and more to follow you around the web, record everything you do, and link that activity directly to you. All without your knowledge or consent. Meanwhile, iBrowe is private by default.",
    "featuresTitle": "Does iBrowe have more features than Edge?",
    "featuresDescription": "Both iBrowe and Edge are built on the open-source Chromium browser engine (the same one used in other browsers like Chrome, Opera, and Vivaldi). So you can expect similar looks and functions. But when it comes to things beyond those similarities, iBrowe has many customizations that Edge can't compete with.",
